# Bank-Marketing-Hit-Prediction
This is based on a Kaggle data set of customer details of a bank: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunamla02/bank-marketing-data-v1
This notebook utilises the said data to predict whether a certain customer will start a "term deposit account".

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits. These generally have a higher interest rate than savings account but lower than fixed deposits.
